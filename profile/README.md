### :family_man_man_girl_boy: About
In our laboratory our student assistants develop applications for the robots :robot: **Pepper** and **Nao**.<br>
These programs are tested with students and then integrated and used in adult teaching. :speech_balloon: <br>
We currently have **6 completed programs** that we would like to share with you. We hope to<br>
be able to build up or be part of a broad, well-connected community, which works with these<br>
or other robots in order to use them in adult teaching.<br>
Here you can find out more about the [BHT KOM-laboratory](https://labor.bht-berlin.de/kom/). :smiley:
<br>

### :robot: Our robots Nao and Pepper

We are working with **Nao 6** and the **Choregraphe build 2.8.6.23**. <br>
Our Pepper has the **robot version 1.8** .<br>

### :computer: Completed programs


[Nao says](https://github.com/Humanoid-Robots-as-Edu-Assistants/Nao_says)
> Nao says (like the popular game Simon says) is a game in which Nao gives instructions to the players to do or not to do something. Then the robot performs the corresponding action and the players have to imitate it. The program currently supports 10 different animations. (It was designed for the "long night of science" in berlin, 2022)
<br>

[Empathy mapping](https://github.com/Humanoid-Robots-as-Edu-Assistants/empathy_mapping)
> Empathy mapping is a method to develop better user experience (UX) design`s. Nao explains to the students what the topic of today's exercise is and then leads them through an example of empathy mapping.
<br>

[Easy breathing](https://github.com/Humanoid-Robots-as-Edu-Assistants/easy_breathing)
> Easy breathing is a simple breathing exercise, which is available in various lengths. NAO helps to maintain an even breathing rhythm with the support of a sound. The sound signals when to breathe in and when to breathe out. It will help to regain focus and to relax.
<br>

[4-7-8-Breathing](https://github.com/Humanoid-Robots-as-Edu-Assistants/4-7-8-Breathing)
> The 4-7-8 breathing exercise is a guided breathing meditation, which helps with anxiety and stress. NAO guides the participant through multiple cycles, in which you breathe in, hold your breath and breathe out while assisting with verbal and visual support. 
<br>

[Evolution Game](https://github.com/Humanoid-Robots-as-Edu-Assistants/evolution_game)
> An exercise to loosen up the lesson. The students spread out in the room and play rock, paper, scissors against each other to rise in rank. If you want, you can play against Nao.
<br>

[Planning Poker](https://github.com/Humanoid-Robots-as-Edu-Assistants/Planning_Poker)
> Planning Poker is an agile method for estimating the time required for specific parts of the project. Nao briefly explains to the participants how planning poker works and then runs them through a test scenario.
